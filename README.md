# Digital Image Steganography
"An Android Application of Digital Image Steganography Techniques" focuses on the development of a mobile application that leverages image steganography for secure communication. 
Steganography is the practice of concealing secret information within an ordinary image, making it imperceptible to the human eye while still allowing authorized parties to retrieve the hidden data.
The project aims to implement various advanced steganographic algorithms, providing a platform on Android devices for users to securely encode and decode messages within digital images.
